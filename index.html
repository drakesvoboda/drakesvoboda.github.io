				<h3>Natural Language Inference</h3>
				<p>
					For the final project in my natural language processing class, my group and I were tasked with solving 
					three natural language inference (NLI) benchmarks:
				</p>		
				<p>
					<strong class="text-white">CommonsenseQA</strong>&mdash;given a common-sense question, choose
					the correct answer out of 5 multiple-choice options
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="text-white">Conversational Entailment</strong>&mdash;given a short dialoge between
					speakers, determine if a given hypothesis can
					be inferred from the dialog.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="text-white">Everyday Actions Text (EAT)</strong>&mdash;determine if a short story is plausible,
					and if it isn't, determine when the story stops making sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					Natural language inference is the problem of determining if a hypothesis can be reasonably infered from a natural language premise.
					NLI is a notoriously difficult problem that requires machines to reason about the meanings of language.
					Deep-learning has been a huge breakthrough in NLP research and has advanced the state-of-the-art for many tasks.
					Not-surprisingly, large transformer models like BERT were the best performers amongst the groups in the class.
					My group and I made use of transformers and&mdash;out of twenty-five teams in the class&mdash;performed fifth best on the Conversational Entailment
					benchmark and third best performance on the EAT benchmark.

				<h3>Static Branch Prediction for LLVM IRs Using Machine Learning</h3>
				<p>
					For the final project in my advanced compilers class, my group and I trained an ML model to predict the bias of
					an assembly branch instruction.
					Static-branch prediction is the process of predicting which direction a branch instruction will take before it is executed.
					Accuracte branch prediction is really important for compilers to make intelligent decisions when optimizing code.
					Our model performs better than LLVM's internal branch predictor, which we think is a really good result.

				<h3>Using RL to beat QWOP</h3>
				<p>
					A friend of mine is really good at the browser game <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>
					where you control a sprinters legs and try to run a 100 meter dash.
					He is so good in fact that he's ranked within the top ten globally.
					I'm competative and wanted to beat him, but I'm also really terrible at the game. 
					I decided the only way to beat him was to resort to using reinforcement learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					I trained my computer to beat the game using an algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization.
					My computer can beat the game, but it isn't faster than my friend.

				<h3>Emoji-AI: Learning to Predict Emojis from 1.8 Million Tweets</h3>
				<p>
					In my second semester at Michigan, I took a special topics class called <i>Applied Machine Learning for Affective Computing</i>.
					The topic of the class was to use machine learning techniques to understand and predict human emotions.
					What better encapsulates the full range of human emotion than emojis?
					For my final project I trained a model to predict what emojis should be used in a natural language input.

				<h3>Deep.ditch: Computer Vision for Automated Road Damage Detection</h3>
				<p>
					This project was my first experience learning about and applying machine learning.
					I became interested in ML as a junior in college and I asked one of my professors and mentors (Dr. Shiyong Lu) if knew of any interesting projects to work on.
					He pointed me towards a vision competition hosted by a workshop at the 2018 IEEE Conference on Big Data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of the competion was to detect and localize instances of road damage in images.
					I taught myself deep-learning and pytorch, trained my model, wrote a report, and submitted my results.
					I placed 10th overall in the competition and my report was accepted by the workshop's reviewers (not bad for an undergrad working alone).
					Unfortunetly, I was unable to attend the conference and my report went unpublished, but hey, I was just happy it got accepted.
				</p>
				<p>
					My senior year, my capstone project team deployed my model to an iOS app that 
					automatically reports road damage.
					The model runs locally on a mobile device and is used to capture images 
					when it detects them and store the images, along with their gps coordinates, to a remote database.
					The idea was that municipalities, who currently rely on individual reports and
					hired experts, could mount smartphones to fleets of vehicles to 
					passivly and automatically locate and report road damage.
