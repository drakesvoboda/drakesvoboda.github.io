			</h2>
			<p>			
				I graduated from <a href="https://wayne.edu/">Wayne State University</a> in 2015 with a bachelor's in computer science and a minor in mathematics.
				Since then I've been pursuing a master's in comp-sci from the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.	
				I have taken graduate level courses covering large scale distributed systems, compilers, artifical intelligence, machine learning, 
				computer vision, and nautral language processing.
				My academic experiences have allowed me to work on a wide variety of software and machine learning projects.		
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout my college career I've worked in web development at <a href="https://www.thinkmoncur.com/">Moncur</a>.
				At work I develop beautiful and performant web experiences with teams of developers and designers.

				<h3>Static Branch Prediction for LLVM IRs Using Machine Learning</h3>
				<ul class="list-inline tags meta text-light-gray">
					<li>Compilers</li>
					<li>AI</li>
					<li>LLVM</li>
					<li>C++</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In my compilers class, my team and I trained both classical and deep-learning models to predict the bias of
					an assembly branch instruction.
					Compilers rely on accurate branch prediction to make intelligent decisions when optimizing code.
					Our best model performs better than LLVM's internal branch predictor which we think is a really good result.

				<h3>Natural Language Inference</h3>
				<ul class="list-inline tags meta text-light-gray">
					<li>NLP</li>
					<li>Python</li>
					<li>PyTorch</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For the final project in my natural language processing class, each group was tasked with solving
					three natural language inference (NLI) benchmarks:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="text-white">CommonsenseQA</strong>&mdash;given a common-sense question, choose
					the correct answer out of 5 multiple-choice options
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="text-white">Conversational Entailment</strong>&mdash;given a short dialoge between
					speakers, determine if a given hypothesis can
					be inferred from the dialog.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="text-white">Everyday Actions Text (EAT)</strong>&mdash;determine if a short story is plausible,
					and if it isn't, determine when the story stops making sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					Natural language inference is a notoriously difficult problem that requires machines to reason about the meanings of language.
					Deep-learning has been a huge breakthrough in NLP research and has advanced the state-of-the-art for NLI.
					My group and I used large transformer models on these benchmarks and&mdash;out of twenty-five teams in the class&mdash;performed fifth best on the Conversational Entailment
					benchmark and third best on the EAT benchmark.

					A friend of mine is really good at <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>: 
					a video game where you control a sprinter's legs to run a 100 meter dash.
					He is so good that he's ranked within the top ten globally.
					I wanted to beat him&mdash;but I'm terrible at the game.
					I decided the only way to win was to resort to reinforcement learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					I trained my computer to beat the game using an algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization.
					My computer can beat the game, but it isn't faster than my friend.

					In my second semester at Michigan, I took a special topics class called <i>Applied Machine Learning for Affective Computing</i>.
					In the class we used machine learning techniques to process natural language, recognize speech, and understand and predict human emotions.
					What better encapsulates the full range of human emotion than emojis?
					For my final project I trained a model to predict what emojis should be used in a natural language input.

					Optical flow estimation is the process of estimating pixel-wise motion between consecutively captured images.
					For the final project in my computer vision class, my group and I implmeneted and trained a large deep-learning model to estimate 
					optical flow in images captured during every-day driving scenarios.

				<h3>2.5-PC: A Faster and Non-Blocking Atomic Commit Protocol</h3>

				<p>
					Atomic commitment is a fundemental problem in distributed systems.
					There are two popular protocols for attomic commitment: 2 phase commit (2PC) and 3 phase commit (3PC).
					2PC is faster than 3PC, however, its progress can be blocked under certain failure senarious.
					For the final project in my distributed systems course, my group and I invented 2.5 phase commit, an atomic commit protocol that is non-blocking 
					like 3PC but only requires the same number of message passing round trips as 2PC.

				<p>
					I took a machine learning course my first semester at Michigan.
					In the class we covered the theoretical and mathematical foundations of several machine learning algorithm.
					For the final project in the course, my project group and I investigated a novel method for regularizing 
					neural nets that applies a triplet loss term at intermediate hidden layers.
					The regularization term induces large margins in the hidden states of a neural-net.
					We found that our method improved both generalization performance and robsutness to adversarial examples on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
					We presented our method at a poster session featuring other projects from the course and our project won first prize for the open-ended project track.

				<h3>Deep.ditch: Computer Vision for Automated Road Damage Detection</h3>
				<ul class="list-inline tags meta text-light-gray">
					<li>Computer Vision</li>
					<li>Core ML</li>
					<li>iOS</li>
					<li>React</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I became interested in machine learning as a junior in college. 
					I asked one of my professors and mentors (Dr. Shiyong Lu) if he knew of any interesting projects 
					I could work on to learn more about the topic.
					He pointed me towards a vision competition hosted by a workshop at the <i>2018 IEEE Conference on Big Data</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of the competion was to detect and localize instances of road damage in images.
					I taught myself deep-learning and PyTorch, trained my model, wrote a report, and submitted my results.
					I placed 10th overall in the competition and my report was accepted by the workshop's reviewers (not bad for an undergrad working alone).
					Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the conference and my report went unpublished, but hey, I was happy it got accepted.
				</p>
				<p>
					My senior year, I lead a capstone project team that deployed my model to an iOS app.
					The model runs locally on device and is used to detect and report road damage a remote service.
